# üß© OVERVIEW

## A. Background

**Great Commissioners International _(GCI)_** Church operates with departments to ensure effective administration and spiritual growth. One of these departments is the **Schools Department**, responsible for training and spiritual formation through structured learning programs such as:

- **School of Foundation**
- **School of Ministry**
- **School of Leadership**

Currently, most school activities are handled **manually or physically** ‚Äî including registration, attendance, progress tracking, and module delivery. This has led to operational inefficiencies, difficulty in data management, and limited scalability.


## B. Problem Statement

| Aspect                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **The Problem of:**                 | Manual handling of school activities leading to errors, delays, poor tracking of student progress, and lack of centralized data.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Which Affects:**                  | Students, instructors, and administrators who struggle with fragmented information, poor communication, and lack of visibility into academic progress and administration.                                                                                                  |
| **For Which a Capable Solution Would Be:** | A centralized web-based platform to manage the activities of all schools under the department.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Which Would:**                   | - Digitize the enrollment and module management process.<br>- Allow students to track their progress.<br>- Empower instructors to structure and manage their modules and students.<br>- Provide administrators with tools to oversee the entire system efficiently.         |
